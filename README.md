# Baseball Name Game

## Background

The baseball name game is a game I used to play with friends and family. The only trace of this game I've found on the internet is [here](https://www.thebaseballjournal.com/fun/the-name-game/), where you can read more about the game.

I used `People.csv` from [Sean Lahman's Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) for all names.
